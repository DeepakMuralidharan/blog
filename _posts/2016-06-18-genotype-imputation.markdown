Abstract:

With the advancements in high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping platforms, there has been an exponential increase in the number of measured genotypes. These advancements have enabled us to understand multi-gene interactions and also develop genetic models that more closely represent the polygenic nature of common disease risk. Studies have shown that the compounded effects of even small amounts of missing data on such analysis is considerable. In this work, we present a bidirectional recurrent neural network based method for imputing missing SNP genotype data. We perform our experiments on a subset of the 1000genomes dataset and our Bi-RNN method accurately predicts around 96% of the missing genotypes on average. We benchmark our results against the MENDEL imputation method and demonstrate that our bi-RNN based imputation method does as well other available methods such as MENDEL even with a vanilla architecture.
