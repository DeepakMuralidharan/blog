In this age of food selfies and photo-centric social storytelling, it may be no surprise to hear that Yelp’s users upload an enormous amount of photos every day alongside their written reviews. Every time a user uploads a photo of a restaurant, the person tags some attributes along with the image that closely describe the restaurant. For example, a user might upload a few photos of a restaurant and tag these images with labels such as ’restaurant is expensive”, ’good for kids’ etc. However till now, this tagging has to be done manually by the user. It would be useful to have a model that automatically recommends these tags for these restaurants based on the photos uploaded by the user. Our project is aimed towards this task of building a system that predicts the attribute labels of restaurants based on user-submitted photos.
