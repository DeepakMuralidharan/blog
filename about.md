I am an Electrical Engineering Masters student at the University of California, Los Angeles and my academic areas of interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence and data mining.

More specifically, I am interested in deep learning and neural networks and their applications in computer vision, speech, natural language processing and health care.

I love computers, software, and making machines think.
